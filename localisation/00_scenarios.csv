IRONBORN_START_DESC;Under the driftwood king Qhored I Hoare the realm of the ironborn reached the peak of its expansion, and it was said that all the western coast of Westeros where the salt of the Sunset Sea could be smelled or the crashing of its waves heard were under their control. Over the centuries the power of the ironborn would diminish and many of the conquests would be lost, but at this point in time that seemed to be only a dream, for reality was a nightmare.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
